.......................................
The Al Wahbah crater (Maqla Tamia in Arabic) is a volcanic crater, which is about 250 kilometers away from Taif, Saudi Arabia, on the western edge of the Harrat Kishb basalt plateau. The Harrat Kishb plateau contains many volcanic cones. It is 250 m (820 ft) deep and 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter. The bottom of the crater is covered with white sodium phosphate crystals.\n\nIt takes a person 45-60 minutes to go to the bottom of the crater. This crater is very slippery and it is hard for people to come up to the surface. To climb back up takes approx 60-90 minutes. There is some mobile phone signal within the crater, and the site receives very few visitors indeed, even over weekends.\n\nWhile it was thought for some time that the crater was formed by a meteorite, as its appearance resembles that of the Barringer Crater, with its circular form and high sides, it is now commonly accepted by geologists that the crater is a maar crater, and was formed by volcanic activity in the form of an underground phreatic eruption – a massive steam explosion generated by molten basaltic magma coming into contact with subterranean water.

Saiysad National park
.......................................
A huge park contains a very nice natural views.
.......................................
It’s a good place to visit if you have time in hand and have nothing to do on that day. There are a lot of gates present all around the park but you can get in only through one of them. However, traveling in large groups is recommended as the place is kind of isolated. Strolling around this park could be fun if you have kids. There are a few slides and some swings that your children can enjoy on.
